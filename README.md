# SampleSugarAccountsCustomVisibility
Custom Accounts visibility to hide flagged records

The customisation will create a new custom checkbox field on Accounts (hidden_c).
If the checkbox is flagged, it will hide the record for all non-admin users or non-admin users for Accounts (through their Role).

The customisation was built and tested on Sugar version 7.9.2.0.
After the installation, run a system repair and Elastic re-index.
